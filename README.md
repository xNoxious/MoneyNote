This is a small JS app to create quick list of spendings and earnings in order to accumulate monthly budget. It does not use any sort of storage to save your budget as I only made it to showcase what I had learned so far about DOM manipulation, prototypes, objects, the prototype chain, functions, first class functions, IIFE, bind, call, apply.
